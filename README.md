<h1>‚ô¶Ô∏è OnlineStore_MVC ‚ô¶Ô∏è</h1>

<h3>
  <b>~~~</b> <ins>Remake</ins> of the old OnlineStore that was made for KPI project. (But better) <b>~~~</b>
</h3>

This is the example of my skillsüéØ in <i>ASP.NET Core 3.1</i>. In this project, I was using 3-layer architecture. 

‚û°Ô∏è <b>DAL</b> represented as layer with base repository methods to work with database entity-table's.<br>
     Also contains a Unit of Work pattern that collect all the repositories into one unit to make easier access for the repositories.<br>
		To work with database I was using <i>Entity Framework Core</i>.<br>
		Main methods are covered by <i>NUnit tests</i> with <i>Moq</i>.
		
‚û°Ô∏è <b>BLL</b> contains all the main logic to work with online store like:<br> 
    working with the shopping cart, showing product list, searching by categories/namings/prices.<br>
		To transfer data I was using <i>AutoMapper</i> to Map base objects created in folder "DTO"
    
‚û°Ô∏è <b>PL</b> is MVC-based layer containing controllers to work with BLL methods.<br>
    It contains views made mostly with bootstrap and partly with own-written CSS.<br>
		For authentication I was using <i>ASP.NET Core Identity</i> with <i>JWT</i>
		
‚úñÔ∏èTo create email-messages for authentication I've added EmailService using <i>NETCore.MailKit</i>
